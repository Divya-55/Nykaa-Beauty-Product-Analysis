/*
Insight #9: Higher-Priced Products Tend to Receive Better Ratings
Products priced between ‚Çπ500‚Äì‚Çπ999 received the highest average rating of 4.06, suggesting this price segment delivers the best value and customer satisfaction.

Lower-priced products (below ‚Çπ500) had average ratings below 4.0, indicating slightly lower perceived quality or satisfaction.

Interestingly, ultra-premium products (‚Çπ1000+) had a lower average rating of 3.97 than the mid-range ‚Äî showing that high price doesn‚Äôt always guarantee higher satisfaction.

üß† Takeaway: Mid-range products (‚Çπ500‚Äì‚Çπ999) may offer the sweet spot in terms of value vs. quality perception. Brands could focus their marketing and product strategy on this price band.
